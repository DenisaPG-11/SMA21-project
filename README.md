Android App Project

This app is a prototype for a TODO List Application. 

As a user of this application, you are able to create an account, functionality managed with the Firebase Authentication Database. 
If you don't already have an account, you can create a new one. 

After you finished the sign in process, you have a dashboard design as Home Screen, wher you can add all of your task.
Each task has a name, a description, a date when was added, and an id.
The functionality to add the real time date for tasks is not covered.
Also, all the data from this part, meaning all the tasks added by the user, should be stored into Realtime Database from Firebase, but because of a bug this part is not yet working.
 
When you have something done, can use Delete button to erase that task from your screen. Also, if something is wrong when you add a task, can use Update button to fix it. 
This 2 button will show, into a popup layout, when the user perform an action to click on a task from Home Screen.
 
After finishing all the tasks, the user can Log out from the application, or can just close it, for not log in next time when wanna add another tasks.
